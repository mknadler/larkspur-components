# Larkspur

Larkspur is a component library / UI framework I am working on. It is in active development and is currently in, like, pre-pre-pre-release. Please come back later :)

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```


## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```
